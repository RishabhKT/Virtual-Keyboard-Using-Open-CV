# Virtual-Keyboard-Using-Open-CV
I've tried to design a "No Touch Keyboard" using OPENCV and Mediapipe, this keyboard uses hand-tracking to write/delete any text, I've used python libraries namely, cvzone and pynputs to track hand-gestures and then write/delete text from any editor like notepad/word, etc.
